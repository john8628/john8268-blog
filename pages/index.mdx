Hey,Friends Greetings from Shanghai, China!
 I'm deeply passionate about the open-source community. Currently, 
 I'm immersed in the world of big data, working on projects involving user profiling and risk assessment. 
 My focus extends to the evolving tech of open data lake storage.
  I'm an active contributor to communities like Apache Seatunnel and Paimon. 
Join me on this journey of exploration and innovation.
